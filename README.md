## General Description
Across the entire globe in the 21st century, we have come to realise that Classical Music is on a constant deteriorating incline in terms of popularity and awareness. In reponse to this crisis, we have strived to produce a website/software which allows classical musicians to find like-minded individuals, and provide them with a overarching number of features to assist their musical lives with technology.
